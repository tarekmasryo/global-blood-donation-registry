# artifacts

This folder is used for generated outputs from the notebook (not committed by default).

Typical outputs:
- `donor_outreach_scored.csv` — scored eligible donors with calibrated probabilities and selected policy
- `model_bundle.joblib` — trained pipeline + calibration + threshold policy + metadata
- `metrics_holdout.json` — evaluation metrics for the holdout window
